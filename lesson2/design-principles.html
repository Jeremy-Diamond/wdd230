           <h3>White Space</h3>
           <p>Trek Bikes</p>

           <img src ="images/trek.png" alt= "Picture of the trek bikes website">
           <p>I think that Trek did a good job using whitespace on their site because each section of text is away from the edges of the screen and isolated from other elements. They also did a good job using the different headers to drive you to focus your eyes where they wanted you to.  </p>

            <h3>Alignment</h3>
            <p>Costco</p>
            <a href="https://www.costco.com/">costco.com/</a>
            <img src ="images/costco.png" alt= "Picture of the costco website">
            <p>Costcoâ€™s alignment on there site is spot on.  All of the items that they have listed are laid out in a perfect grid with images on top and details below.  Everything is laid out in a way that is very intuitive to use.  I also like how the scrolling image for the coupons is taking up exactly two parts of the grid so even though it is double in size it is still aligned.</p>

            <h3>Repetition</h3>

            <p>Skidoo did a great job with the repetition on their site.  I especially liked how they used their branding colors on the outer edges alternating sides.  I think it both looks cool and really helps break up the different sections of the site as you are scrolling. </p>
