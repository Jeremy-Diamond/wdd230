        <h2>Target Audience</h2>

        <p>Our target audience will be split between our local business owners and their
             current/potential customers. There will be several small to medium businesses
              that will want to sponsor and help run several of our events througouth the
               year in order to drive name and brand recognition for them.  Next to them 
               we have several local sales representatives for various companies in our city
                that use our events for networking and driving business.

            <h2>Persona One- Local Business Owner</h2>
                <img src="images/davyjones.jpg" alt="Davy Jones Photo">
                    <p> Davey Jones is a local business owner who makes specialized sailboats.
                        He is the best there is and the boats he makes are top notch, but he 
                        is more comfortable on the water than he is on land which makes finding
                        customers a bit difficult for him. He really relies on the chamber to
                            spread the word about his boats.  He is in his late 50â€™s and has never
                            found much use for a cell phone, so when he visits the chamber website
                            it will be from his laptop.  Since he uses his computer so little he really
                            counts on the sites he goes to be really intuitive.
                    </p>

            <h2>Persona Two- Local Sales Executive</h2>
                <img src="images/MichaelWayne.png" alt="Michael Wayne Photo">
                        <p>Michael Wayne is a sales executive for the local IT service company in Diamond City.
                            The problem is that he is new to the area and was struggling to make new contacts
                            with the right people until he found the chamber.  He is always on the go making
                                visits, so sitting down at a desk on the computer is very rare.  Michael lives 
                                on his phone so our site needs to be really responsive and perform well on mobile
                                or it will be useless to him.
